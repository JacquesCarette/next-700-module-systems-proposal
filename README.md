<h3> Extending Dependently-Typed Languages to Implement Module System Features In The Core Language </h3>

This repository contains the research proposal for my doctoral studies at McMaster University
under the supervision of Jacques Carette and Wolfram Kahl.

*What are and what should be the module systems of DTLs?*
*DTLs remove distinctions between packaging systems and so*
*using pedestrian modules systems is not necessarily the best route.*

-   A requirements driven approach to coherent modularisarion constructs in Dependently-typed languages.
-   Main Question: *What are the module systems for Dependently-Typed Languages?*
-   Goal: Extend Agda to be powerful enough to implement the module system features, in the core language, that people want to do.

    In user facing libraries, [redundancies are desirable](https://inf.ug.edu.pl/~schwarzw/papers/mkm2010.pdf)
    since they may utilise a a variety of aliases for what user want, this is useful
    flexibility.

    -   However, in the source file, each item should only exist once.
    -   The front-end redundancy should be produced by machine generation,

rather than by hand.
